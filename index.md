Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ LangGraph is seriously cool â€“ it's the open-source Python/JavaScript library that lets you build really smart apps with Large Language Models (LLMs). Forget those clunky old chain setups, LangGraph uses graphs, which gives you way more control over how your AI app flows, manages its memory, and even lets you bring humans into the loop for feedback. Pretty neat, huh?

So, why did I put this cheatsheet together? Well, honestly, learning LangGraph felt a bit like a treasure hunt! At least when I was learning, the information was scattered _everywhere_ â€“ official docs, GitHub repos, the LangGraph academy, Reddit threads, even random tweets! Plus, if Iâ€™m being real, my memory isnâ€™t the greatest. I kept finding myself re-learning the same things over and over.

Thatâ€™s why I decided to create this document. Basically, itâ€™s a favor to my future self! I wanted a single, reliable place to quickly look up the key stuff when building with LangGraph. If it helps you out too, awesome! Consider it a win-win.
